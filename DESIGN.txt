DESIGN DOCUMENT
The structure and build schedule of the Storytime project
===========================================================


Collaborators - Kenny Chen, Fabiola Radosav, Jan Kowalski

Mission Statement - 
	Collaborative story maker
	Multiple users are able to interact with a collection of stories.
	Users can read from the stories and append their additions.

User Interface - CLI
	Once the user starts the program, they will be presented with a list of 
	potential stories to read and edit
	User will also be able to type 'help' for a list of valid commands.
		help, create, read, edit, exit
	The user will be able to type commands to either create a new story, 
	choose a story to read, or add to a story.
	Adding to a story will automatically present the user with the 
	updated story.
	Use Ctrl-D (EOF) to end editing a file
		
Technical Design -
	Multiple Client - Server Model
		Processes (fork)

	Technical Concepts:
		Semaphores to limit how many people can edit a file at once
		Mini-interpreter: server interprets user's commands
		Working with files / directories

	Expansions:
		stat: time of last access
		Networking 
		Random sentence generator
		Text editor - for editing (not just appending)

	Files:
		client.c
			int main()
				Connect to server
				Read stdin, send data to subserver, read from subserver
			
		server.c
			static void sighandler(int)
				remove wkp on program end
			void process(char *)
				interpret the command
			void subserver(int)
				handle working with the user
			int main()
				renews wkp, allocates subserver


		pipe_networking.c / .h
			int client_handshake(int *)
			int server_setup()
			int server_connect(int)
			
		stories/
			directory for story text files

Timeline -
	Wait until the last millisecond

		
	Task 0: Port over the code from fserver assignment
		12/22/17 Group
	Task 1: Change the process to interpret commands
		12/27/17 Kenny
	Task 2: Write function that creates a semaphore for all stories on access. (Read, Write) 
		12/30/17 Jan
	Task 3: Have the subserver read from stories and write from stories
		1/3/17 Fabiola
	
	Milestone 0: 1 client and 1 story

	Milestone 1: multiple clients and 1 story (semaphore fun)

	Milestone 2: multiple clients and multiple stories (lots of semaphore fun)
