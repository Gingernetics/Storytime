Once upon a time, there was a red prince.
His father was a generous king, frequently
hosting feasts for the peasants (of course,
using the taxes from the peasants).

But one day, the king got very sick.
"Oohhh. I might not make it to tomorrow."
He said to his only son.
"Oh, Father! How can I make you feel better?"
The son asked.
"There is no cure.... Except maybe on Mars."
He hesitantly said.
"But why Mars?"
The son curiously questioned.
"Because Mars is red."
